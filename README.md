This is the a node js api for an weather app.

This makes use of some of the high use cases like Getting the ip address of the client making request to the server 
and finding the location (country,state and city etc.) and then making us of Openweather api to find he weather conditions 
over the area.


This is not the only use, many others are also possible based on the needs.

This  also needs a service Ngrok to make a tunnel the localhost to get IP address.


HAPPY LEARNING!
